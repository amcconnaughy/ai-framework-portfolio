# Prompt Design Principles

**Purpose:** Simple, reusable guidance for writing prompts that produce safe, accurate, and useful outputs. All examples are synthetic.

**Alignment:** Prompts designed with these principles produce outputs that score well on the Universal Evaluation — Sample Framework. See `01-evaluation-frameworks/evaluation-framework` for the complete scoring rubric.

## 1) Goals and constraints

- **Primary goals:** correctness, safety, usefulness, and time savings for the end user  
- **Audience:** state who will use the output (role/persona) and adopt an appropriate professional tone  
- **Data:** do not include private/sensitive information; use synthetic placeholders unless explicit consent and policy allow otherwise  
- **Policy fit:** align with applicable laws, organizational policies, and reviewer guidelines  
- **Evaluation fit:** prompts should be easy to score with your evaluation rubric

## 2) General rules that prevent most errors

1. **State the role and audience.** Say who the assistant is and who reads the output.  
2. **Give minimal, concrete context.** Include purpose, constraints, success criteria, timeline/length.  
3. **Specify an output structure.** Ask for labeled sections or bullets the evaluator can scan.  
4. **Set guardrails.** Safety, privacy, fairness (avoid stereotypes), and refusal behavior for unsafe/unsupported requests.  
5. **Ask for brief rationales, not step-by-step reasoning.** One or two sentences explaining key choices.  
6. **Bound the length.** Provide a word or bullet limit so outputs are skimmable.  
7. **Optionally request one alternative.** Encourages variety without noise.  
8. **Self-check.** Require two quick checks before finishing (e.g., “meets success criteria,” “two concrete supports/tips included”).  
9. **Reference hygiene.** When facts matter, ask for a brief reference type (e.g., “policy,” “standard,” “manual”).  
10. **Tone and readability.** Match audience expectations; keep language clear and accessible.

**Default length bounds (tune per team):**  
- Short guidance/notes: 80–120 words  
- Procedures/mini-plans: ≤ 220 words  
- Refusals/safety notes: ≤ 80 words

## 3) Standard prompt layout

**Role** — who the assistant is (e.g., “process aide,” “communications editor,” “safety reviewer”).  
**Audience** — who will read/use the output.  
**Context** — purpose, constraints, success criteria, timing.  
**Task** — what to produce (artifact + structure).  
**Guardrails** — safety, privacy, fairness, refusal behavior.  
**Output structure** — labeled sections/bullets to ensure scannability.  
**Quality check** — 2 quick confirmations tied to success criteria.  
**Length** — the bound you want followed.

## 4) Reusable output structures

### 4.1 Mini-plan (sections)
- **Outcome:** one sentence, measurable if applicable  
- **Prerequisites/Inputs:** 2–5 bullets  
- **Steps:** concise sequence from simple to complex  
- **Validation/Acceptance:** 1–3 items to confirm success  
- **Adjustments/Support:** two concrete tips for different user needs  
- **Brief rationale:** one sentence on alignment and usefulness

### 4.2 Safety review (sections)
- **Decision:** safe / unsafe / refuse with alternative  
- **Issues (if any):** privacy / fairness / appropriateness / risky instruction  
- **Reason:** one to two sentences in plain language  
- **Suggested alternative (if refusing):** one sentence  
- **Escalation note (if relevant):** when and whom to involve

### 4.3 Lightweight quality labels
- Allowed labels: outcome missing / sequence unclear / validation absent / complete  
- Optional confidence note: one sentence explaining the choice

## 5) Prompt templates (plain text)

### 5.1 Mini-plan generator
**Role:** process aide  
**Audience:** practitioners who need a concise plan  
**Context:** purpose, constraints, success criteria, time available  
**Task:** create a mini-plan using the “Mini-plan (sections)” structure  
**Guardrails:** no PII/PHI/PCI, no secrets/tokens, no live customer data; use placeholders; fair and unbiased; professional tone  
**Quality check:** outcome measurable (if applicable); two concrete adjustments/supports included  
**Length:** ≤ 220 words

### 5.2 Short communication writer
**Role:** communications editor  
**Audience:** stakeholders (non-technical)  
**Context:** topic, tone, action requested, privacy constraints  
**Task:** draft a short message using these sections: greeting; purpose; next steps; sign-off  
**Guardrails:** no PII/PHI/PCI or secrets; placeholders only; neutral and respectful; one simple action  
**Length:** 80–120 words

### 5.3 Safety refusal with alternatives
**Role:** safety reviewer  
**Request:** a user asks for content that appears unsafe or policy-restricted  
**Task:** refuse and offer a safe alternative using the “Safety review (sections)” structure  
**Guardrails:** no PII/PHI/PCI or secrets; calm, audience-appropriate; do not provide risky steps  
**Length:** ≤ 80 words

## 6) Pattern library: helpful micro-instructions

- Use varied names and contexts in examples to avoid stereotype patterns.  
- Provide two concrete supports/tips, not generic advice.  
- Add a short validation/acceptance check aligned to the stated outcome.  
- If the request seems adversarial or coded to bypass policy, refuse and propose a safe alternative.  
- Keep outputs skimmable with clear section headers.  
- When facts matter, include a brief reference type (“policy,” “standard,” “manual”).

## 7) Quick troubleshooting

| Symptom               | Likely cause                | Fix                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing validation    | Output structure unclear    | Add a “Validation/Acceptance” section with 1–3 items                 |
| Weak adjustments      | Vague instruction           | Require “two concrete supports/tips” and give examples               |
| Overlong output       | No length bound             | Add a word or bullet limit                                          |
| Hallucinated facts    | No reference cue            | Ask for a brief reference type; narrow the scope                     |
| Unsafe suggestion     | Missing guardrails          | Add refusal rule and require a safe alternative                      |
| Off-tone writing      | Audience not specified      | State audience and require a matching tone                           |

## 8) Framework alignment guide

When designing prompts to produce high-scoring outputs, map your instructions to evaluation criteria:

| Prompt Element | Framework Criterion             | What to specify                                     |
|----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Outcome        | Outcome Clarity                  | Clear success bar or observable result               |
| Steps          | Sequencing/Process               | Logical progression with prerequisites               |
| Validation     | Validation/Acceptance            | Concrete checks tied to outcome                      |
| Supports       | Differentiation & Accessibility  | Two concrete accommodations for different needs      |
| Guardrails     | Safety & Compliance + Accuracy   | Privacy rules, fairness checks, refusal behavior     |

**Scoring guidance:**  
- Score six dimensions 0–2 each: Accuracy, Safety & Compliance, Outcome Clarity, Sequencing/Process, Validation/Acceptance, Differentiation & Accessibility  
- Provide one short note explaining any score of 0 or 1  
- Do not include step-by-step reasoning in the output  

**Decision labels:** Auto-Approve (Ready) / Human Review (Draft) / Regenerate / Reject
