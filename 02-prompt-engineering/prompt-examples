# Before/After Prompt Examples

**Purpose:** Demonstrate prompt improvement across contexts. Each pair shows a weak prompt, why it failed, and a corrected prompt that aligns with the rubric. Word limits prevent structure caps.

**Alignment:** See `01-evaluation-frameworks/evaluation-framework` for complete scoring rubric.

All examples are synthetic; no real user data.

## Example 1: Accuracy Improvement (Healthcare)

**Initial prompt (Regenerate — 9/20)**
```
Write discharge instructions for heart failure patients.
```

**Why it failed:** No audience; no safety or source constraints; no structure; no validation or plain-language requirement. Output hallucinated dosages and omitted escalation.

**Improved prompt (target ≤ 180 words)**
```
Role: Patient education writer
Audience: Heart failure patients (6th–8th grade reading level)
Context: Discharge instructions for patients leaving hospital after heart failure treatment
Task: Create a guide with these sections:
  - What to watch for: 3–4 warning signs in plain language
  - Daily actions: 2–3 specific behaviors
  - When to call your care team: clear triggers and number placeholder
  - Validation/Acceptance: how success will be confirmed
Guardrails:
  - Plain language (e.g., say "swelling" not "edema")
  - No specific medication names or dosages; defer to care team
  - Include teach-back prompt: "Can you tell me in your own words…"
  - Escalation: call care team at [number] or emergency services for red-flag symptoms
Quality check:
  - Terms at 6th–8th grade level
  - Two concrete warning signs included
```

**Acceptance bar for raters:** Teach-back documented; patient can list two daily actions and two warning signs correctly.

**Expected score:** A2, S2, Outcome 2, Seq 2, Validation 2, Diff 1 → 19/20 (Auto-Approve)

## Example 2: Safety Improvement (K-12 Education)

**Initial prompt (Reject — Safety 0)**
```
Create a science experiment for 5th graders about chemical reactions using household items.
```

**Why it failed:** No safety constraints; "household items" invites unsafe mixtures; no supervision or cleanup; age level unspecified.

**Improved prompt (target ≤ 200 words)**
```
Role: Elementary science curriculum writer
Audience: 5th grade teachers (students ages 10–11)
Context: Safe classroom demo of a chemical reaction
Task: Write a mini-lesson with sections:
  - Learning objective (observable)
  - Materials (classroom-safe only)
  - Safety requirements (PPE, supervision, ventilation)
  - Steps (simple → complex)
  - Observation questions (2–3)
  - Validation/Acceptance (what students can explain after)
Guardrails — SAFETY CRITICAL:
  - Use only: baking soda, vinegar, dish soap, food coloring, water
  - Do not substitute materials beyond the approved list
  - Never mix cleaners or chemicals beyond this list
  - Adult supervision required throughout; include proper cleanup/disposal
  - Define "chemical reaction" in kid-friendly terms
Quality check:
  - Materials limited to the approved list
  - Adult supervision explicitly stated
```

**Acceptance bar for raters:** Students explain why bubbles formed and define "chemical reaction" in 1–2 sentences; teacher checks with a 3-point rubric.

**Expected score:** 20/20 (Auto-Approve)

## Example 3: Structure & Validation Improvement (Customer Education)

**Initial prompt (Human Review — 13/20)**
```
Explain how to import contacts into our CRM system.
```

**Why it failed:** No structure; no success criteria; version ambiguity; no troubleshooting; weak accessibility.

**Improved prompt (target ≤ 220 words)**
```
Role: Customer education specialist
Audience: CRM administrators (intermediate technical skill)
Context: Bulk contact import in CRM v3.2 using CSV
Task: Produce a how-to with sections:
  - Outcome: measurable success
  - Prerequisites: 2–4 items
  - Steps: 6–8 numbered steps
  - Validation/Acceptance: specific checks
  - Troubleshooting: two common issues and fixes
  - Supports: two accessibility aids (e.g., screen-reader note; keyboard-only navigation; low-bandwidth CSV split)
Guardrails:
  - Version 3.2 features only (do not mix versions)
  - Use placeholder data (no real customer info)
  - CSV requirements: UTF-8; keep template headers; no extra columns
  - Where to get help: Help → Import Assistant
Quality check:
  - Validation/Acceptance has specific success criteria
  - Troubleshooting addresses file format and duplicate detection
  - Two accessibility supports are present (screen reader + one additional)
```

**Acceptance bar for raters:** Import summary shows 0 errors; created/merged counts match preview; spot-check 3–5 records for field mapping.

**Expected score:** 20/20 (Auto-Approve)

## Example 4: Differentiation & Accessibility Improvement (Corporate Training)

**Initial prompt (Human Review — 14/20)**
```
Write a training guide on our new expense reporting process.
```

**Why it failed:** One-size-fits-all; no mobile path; no supports; validation vague.

**Improved prompt (target ≤ 200 words)**
```
Role: Corporate learning designer
Audience: All employees (mixed digital literacy; some mobile-only)
Context: New expense reporting process for a 500+ employee company
Task: Provide a guide with sections:
  - Process goal (one sentence)
  - Prerequisites (account/app)
  - Steps (5–6)
  - Validation/Acceptance (observable success)
  - Differentiation & Accessibility — include at least two (required):
    • Mobile vs. desktop paths
    • Manager approval shortcut for frequent submitters
    • Visual learner note: "Screenshots available in help center"
    • Low-bandwidth option: "Offline mode available in app settings"
Guardrails:
  - Plain language for non-finance staff
  - Include where to get help (person/channel)
  - Respect privacy (no real receipts or personal data)
```

**Acceptance bar for raters:** Submission status shows "Submitted" or "Approved"; confirmation email received within 5 minutes.

**Expected score:** 19/20 (Auto-Approve)
